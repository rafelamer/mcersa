You can compile this code in Linux, OS X, FreeBSD, SunOS and Fiwix.
In the folder mcersa-1.0.0 type

$ make
$ sudo make install

and the shared library is installed in /usr/local/lib and include files in
/usr/local/include/mce

Notes:

- In FreeBSD and SunOS you must use gmake instead of make

- In Fiwix, a static library is installed

- In OS X you must intall the gcc compiler. Type gcc in a terminal and if the compiler
is not installed, you will get a window saying that "The gcc command requires the 
command line developer tools. Would you like to install the tools now?"

Click "Install"

- In SunOS you need to do
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib


- In the folders dertests, crypttests and rsatests, you can find some examples of
use of the library. I encourage you to write a complet program that uses the different
functions of the library.

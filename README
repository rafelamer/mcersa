The README file from de repository says:

This repository contains code which implements several crypto operations:

 * perform EME-OAEP encoding, as specified in PKCS#1 version 2.1, using the Tiger hash
 * perform RSA encryption, decryption, and signing operations using the GMP library [TODO]

To test the oaep code, do this:

 $ gcc -O0 -ggdb -Wall -W -DTEST tiger.o sboxes.o oaep.c -o oaep && ./oaep SomeRandomString

Notes:

To use the OAEP interface, see documentation in oaep.h.
The Tiger code provided herein is largely unmodified from the reference implementation:

About

These are basic implementations of standard cryptography algorithms, written by Brad Conte (brad@bradconte.com) from
scratch and without any cross-licensing. They exist to provide publically accessible, restriction-free implementations
of popular cryptographic algorithms, like AES and SHA-1. These are primarily intended for educational and pragmatic
purposes (such as comparing a specification to actual implementation code, or for building an internal application
that computes test vectors for a product). The algorithms have been tested against standard test vectors.

This code is released into the public domain free of any restrictions. The author requests acknowledgement if the
code is used, but does not require it. This code is provided free of any liability and without any quality
claims by the author.

Note that these are not cryptographically secure implementations. They have no resistence to side-channel attacks and
should not be used in contexts that need cryptographically secure implementations.

These algorithms are not optimized for speed or space. They are primarily designed to be easy to read, although
some basic optimization techniques have been employed.

Building

The source code for each algorithm will come in a pair of a source code file and a header file. There should be
no inter-header file dependencies, no additional libraries, no platform-specific header files, or any other
complicating matters. Compiling them should be as easy as adding the relevent source code to the project.



I have dowloaded the file pkcs5_pbkdf2.c is from http://bxr.su/OpenBSD/lib/libutil/pkcs5_pbkdf2.c
See also the list of List of PBKDF2 implementations in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PBKDF2_implementations.
Also, I have done some minor modifications in pkcs5_pbkdf2.c so that I can compile it in Linux.

# Implementation of the RSA algorithm for educational purposes

I'm teaching a course about mathematics and computer science at the Technical University of Catalonia BarcelonaTech and I started a project about multiprecision arithmetic of integers: how to store arbitrarily  large integers  in the memory of a computer and how to add, subtract or multiply them. As the project evolved over time, I was interested in cryptography and the RSA algorithm.

One of the goals of the project was that my students could study the code and that this was as simple as possible, so that I discarded complex libraries like OpenSSL or GNU GMP. Then, I wrote my own library for educational purposes. I'm not a cryptographer and I'm sure that it has bugs and should not be used  in contexts that need cryptographically secure implementation. Use OpenSSL instead.

To complement the RSA algorithms, I needed some symmetric cryptographic algorithms, so I downloaded different implementations from [https://github.com/Rupan/rsa](https://github.com/Rupan/rsa), [http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/Reports/Tiger/](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/Reports/Tiger/), [https://github.com/B-Con/crypto-algorithms](https://github.com/B-Con/crypto-algorithms), [http://bxr.su/OpenBSD/lib/libutil/pkcs5_pbkdf2.c](http://bxr.su/OpenBSD/lib/libutil/pkcs5_pbkdf2.c) and [https://github.com/ogay/sha2](https://github.com/ogay/sha2)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and install the library you need a Unix-like computer with a compiler (GCC) and the only library needed is zlib. I have tested the installation in Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenIndiana (a fork of OpenSolaris) and Fiwix. On Minix it has been compiled with clang.

### Installing

To install the library, you have to run the following commands
```
~$ git clone https://github.com/rafelamer/mcersa.git
~$ cd mcersa
~$ make
~$ sudo make install
```
In Minix, FreeBSD and OpenIndiana you need *gmake* instead of *make*

## Running the tests

The folders *rsatests*, *crypttests* and *dertests* contains different tests and examples of use of the functions in the the library. To compile the tests do
```
~$ cd dertests
~$ make
~$ cd ../cryptotests
~$ make
~$ cd ../rsatests
~$ make
```
